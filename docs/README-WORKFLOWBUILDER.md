# Workflow Builder & Canvas ‚Äî How to Use

_Last updated: 2025-10-02_

This guide explains **how to use** the Workflow Builder & Canvas after the latest fixes (infinite palette, ports, linking, validity, inspector, context menu). It intentionally avoids internal code details.

---

## What you can do

- **Drag actions** from the palette into the canvas (as many times as you want).
- **Connect nodes** by clicking the **right port** (source) then the **left port** (target).
- **Right‚Äëclick** nodes or links for **Configure / Delete**.
- Edit action parameters in the **Inspector** (right side panel).
- **Validate** a workflow: it‚Äôs valid only when **all nodes are wired**:
  - `Input` must have **‚â•1 outgoing** connection.
  - `Result` must have **‚â•1 incoming** connection.
  - Every **Action** must have **‚â•1 incoming and ‚â•1 outgoing** connection.
- **Save** your workflow (nodes + edges) and **reload** it later to continue.

---

## At a glance (UI areas)

- **Palette** (left): list of available actions. Drag to create nodes. Items **do not disappear** when dragged.
- **Canvas** (center): graph view (Dagre layout). Nodes show labels and small circular **ports**.
- **Inspector** (right overlay): appears when you select a node or choose **Configure**. Fields depend on the action type.
- **Context menu**: right‚Äëclick a node or a link to **Configure** (nodes) or **Delete** (nodes/links).
- **Helper text** (bottom): quick reminder of how to connect nodes.

---

## Getting started

1. Open the Workflow Builder screen from your app (e.g., _Create Workflow_).
2. In the **Palette**, pick an action and **drag** it into the **Canvas**.
3. **Repeat**: you can drop the same action **multiple times**.
4. Click a node‚Äôs **right port** (source), then click another node‚Äôs **left port** (target) to connect them.
5. **Right‚Äëclick** any action node ‚Üí **Configure** to open the **Inspector** and set its parameters.
6. Keep adding actions and connections until the **Save** button becomes enabled (graph is valid).
7. Click **Save** ‚Äî your app should persist `{ name, nodes, edges }`.

> Tip: Start by connecting **Input ‚Üí Action(s) ‚Üí Result**. The builder enforces that Input has an output and Result has an input.

---

## Actions (default set)

- **Chat (basic)** ‚Äî free‚Äëform prompt.
- **Chat on file(s)** ‚Äî prompt + one or more files.
- **Compare two files** ‚Äî two file inputs (left/right).
- **Summarize file** ‚Äî one file input with a target summary length.
- **Extract entities** ‚Äî list entities (comma‚Äëseparated), optional text input.

> Your product team can add more actions; they‚Äôll automatically appear in the palette and the Inspector will adapt.

---

## Ports & connections

- Ports appear as small circles on node sides:
  - **Right side** = **output (source)**.
  - **Left side** = **input (target)**.
- **Input** node exposes **only an output** port.
- **Result** node exposes **only an input** port.
- **Actions** expose **both** input & output ports.
- To connect: **click output ‚Üí click input** (same as ‚ÄúA then B‚Äù).

> If a connection isn‚Äôt allowed (e.g., incompatible types), the click simply does nothing and the pending connection resets.

---

## Validity rules (when the Save button enables)

A workflow is **valid** when **every node** participates in the graph according to these rules:

- **Input** (`input-node`) has **at least one outgoing** edge.
- **Result** (`result-node`) has **at least one incoming** edge.
- Every **Action** node has **at least one incoming** **and** **at least one outgoing** edge.

> The builder shows validity via the `validityChange` output; your wrapper can use it to enable/disable Save.

---

## Inspector (editing an action)

How to open:

- **Click** a node, or
- **Right‚Äëclick** the node ‚Üí **Configure**.

What you see:

- A tailored form for that action type (e.g., prompt, files, entities).
- Error messages if required fields are missing (e.g., both files needed for **Compare**).

How to apply:

- Fill in the fields and click **Apply**. The node stores your parameters in its `params` object.

---

## Right‚Äëclick menu

On **nodes**:

- **Configure** ‚Äî opens the Inspector for this node.
- **Delete** ‚Äî removes the node and its connected edges (not allowed on Input/Result).
- **Close** ‚Äî dismisses the menu.

On **links**:

- **Delete** ‚Äî removes the connection.
- **Close** ‚Äî dismisses the menu.

---

## Drag & Drop behavior

- Dragging from the **Palette** into the **Canvas** creates a **new node** (copy behavior).
- The original palette button **stays** in the palette, so you can drag the same action **infinitely**.
- If a drag is canceled or dropped outside, the palette item returns automatically.

---

## Saving & loading

- **Saving**: collect `{ name, nodes, edges }` from the builder page and persist it in your backend.
- **Files**: if your actions include file uploads, upload files first and store **file references** (IDs/URLs) in `params`.
- **Loading**: on re‚Äëopen, provide the saved `nodes` and `edges` to the canvas input to rebuild the graph.

---

## Version & compatibility

- Angular **16‚Äì19** tested; standalone components and **Signals** are used.
- Uses `@swimlane/ngx-graph` (Dagre), `d3`, and Angular CDK Drag & Drop.
- Works with your Dynamic Form system (`FieldConfigService`, `DynamicFormComponent`).

---

## Tips

- Keep your canvas container visible with a fixed height (e.g., **640px**) to avoid page growth.
- Use the helper message as a quick tooltip for new users.
- Name your actions clearly for easier debugging and UX clarity (node label = action label).

---

## Troubleshooting

- **I can‚Äôt connect nodes** ‚Üí Ensure you‚Äôre clicking the **right port** of the source, then the **left port** of the target.
- **Save stays disabled** ‚Üí Some node likely has no incoming or outgoing edge. Check Input and Result are connected.
- **Files don‚Äôt appear** ‚Üí Some actions require files; open the **Inspector** and attach the required files, then **Apply**.
- **The canvas keeps growing** ‚Üí Make sure the container has a fixed height and that the canvas is not measuring itself.

---

## Change highlights (what‚Äôs new)

- Infinite palette (drag the same action any number of times).
- Ports corrected: **Input has output**, **Result has input**.
- Port‚Äëto‚Äëport linking by clicks (A‚Äôs right port ‚Üí B‚Äôs left port).
- Right‚Äëclick context menu for nodes/links (Configure/Delete).
- Validity: **all nodes must be wired**; special rules for Input/Result.
- Stable canvas sizing; improved touch/scroll responsiveness.
